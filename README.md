# Understanding Perception of VR Technology in the Classroom
### How does that amount of time spent using virtual reality and field of study impact the improvement of learning?

This project was a final project submission for MATH 137 (Probability and Statistics I) at Hofstra University, taken during the Fall 2024 semester under Prof. Angel Pineda.

We wanted to determine the impact of virtual reality on the improvement of education while taking special interest in the studentsâ€™ field of study. We used the attached dataset for the final project, which includes both qualitative and quantitative data from students of various educational levels on their perspective and experience of using virtual reality in the classroom. We initally analyzed the correlation between the students' fields of study and how often they use virtual reality in the classroom with their perception on academic performance but followed that up by determine if outside factors (including teachers' perspectives on VR usage in the classroom) could affect the students' opinions and academic performance.

Virtual reality in the classroom can provide students with hands-on experience through simulations relevant to their field of study. Colleges and universities worldwide are introducing VR technologies that allow students to practice public speaking and interpersonal communication, preparing for giving presentations, medical schools and facilities offer virtual reality training to understand the human body and practice surgical techniques, and engineering students can craft designs and analyze their functionality and aesthetics in a virtual environment, and art students can use virtual reality to create 3D models and draw and paint in 3D. Introducing VR technologies into various fields of study reduces human risk and costly materials to be purchased for projects, allowing for students to work on key career skills on-demand.
